<h1>The Golden Apple Tree and the Nine Peahens, Part I</h1>

<p>Our next theme concerns what I shall tongue-in-cheek refer to as &quot;wif-swans&quot;: Woman-swans, or wife-swans. Because the Old English word for <em>woman</em> is <em>wif</em>, and this is relevant because the Old English word for <em>man</em> is <em>wer</em>, from which we derive <em>werewolf</em> and <em>weregild</em> (man-price, blood money). This particular version comes from Serbia, only they switch it up by using peahens.</p>

<p>Once upon a time there lived a king who had three sons. Now, before the king's palace grew a golden apple tree, which in one and the same night blossomed, bore fruit, and lost all its fruit, though no one could tell who took the apples. One day the king, speaking to his eldest son, said, &quot;I should like to know who takes the fruit from our apple tree!&quot;</p>
<p>And the son said, &quot;I will keep guard tonight, and will see who gathers the apples.&quot;</p>
<p>So when the evening came he went and laid himself down, under the apple tree, upon the ground to watch. Just, however, as the apples ripened, he fell asleep, and when he awoke in the morning, there was not a single one left on the tree. Whereupon he went and told his father what had happened.</p>
<p>Then the second son offered to keep watch by the tree, but he had no better success than his eldest brother.</p>
<p>So the turn came to the king's youngest son to keep guard. He made his preparations, brought his bed under the tree, and immediately went to sleep. Before midnight he awoke and looked up at the tree, and saw how the apples ripened, and how the whole palace was lit up by their shining.</p>
<p>At that minute nine peahens flew towards the tree, and eight of them settled on its branches, but the ninth alighted near him and turned instantly into a beautiful girl -- so beautiful, indeed, that the whole kingdom could not produce one who could in any way compare with her.</p>
<p>She stayed, conversing kindly with him, till after midnight, then thanking him for the golden apples, she prepared to depart. But, as he begged she would leave him one, she gave him two, one for himself and one for the king his father. Then the girl turned again into a peahen, and flew away with the other eight. Next morning, the king's son took the two apples to his father, and the king was much pleased, and praised his son.</p>
<p>When the evening came, the king's youngest son took his place again under the apple tree to keep guard over it. He again conversed as he had done the night before with the beautiful girl, and brought to his father, the next morning, two apples as before.</p>
<p>But, after he had succeeded so well several nights, his two elder brothers grew envious because he had been able to do what they could not. At length they found an old woman, who promised to discover how the youngest brother had succeeded in saving the two apples. So, as the evening came, the old woman stole softly under the bed which stood under the apple tree, and hid herself. And after a while, came also the king's son, and laid himself down as usual to sleep. When it was near midnight the nine peahens flew up as before, and eight of them settled on the branches, and the ninth stood by his bed, and turned into a most beautiful girl.</p>
<p>Then the old woman slowly took hold of one of the girl's curls, and cut it off, and the girl immediately rose up, changed again into a peahen and flew away, and the other peahens followed her, and so they all disappeared.</p>
<p>Then the king's son jumped up, and cried out, &quot;What is that?&quot; and, looking under the bed, he saw the old woman, and drew her out. Next morning he order her to be tied to a horse's tail, and so torn to pieces. But the peahens never came back, so the king's son was very sad for a long time, and wept at his loss.</p>
